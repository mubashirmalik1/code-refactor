# Code Refactor Digitaltolk
I have reviewed the code and identified areas that needed improvement. I made the following changes:

I optimized the code by replacing some if conditions with more efficient where clauses in the sendNotificationTranslator method of the BookingRepository class (\DTApi\Repository\BookingRepository::sendNotificationTranslator).

I eliminated unnecessary data transformations, simplified the logic, and removed redundant for loops and if statements in order to improve performance in the BookingRepository class (refactor/app/Repository/BookingRepository.php:414).

Additionally, I addressed code indentation, removed unused and unnecessary variables, and eliminated redundant if and else statements. I also removed the response() method, as Laravel automatically converts data into the appropriate response format.

I successfully refactored the BookingController completely. However, I apologize for not being able to perform the same level of refactoring for the BookingRepository due to time constraints. Please understand that I have a full-time job and a commute of over 3 hours. If selected for the job, I will dedicate my full attention and time to it.
